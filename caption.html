        When audiences enter the exhibition, each museum has their traffic line they set up for visitors to experience the exhibition effectively. In this respect, the list of artworks on the main screen is the same as the list of artworks in the museum along the traffic line. In addition, the reduction ratio of sizes of works is the same with real sizes.

        This app consists of five categories such as caption, the workplace of the work (map-based), pictures that were taken when an artist was doing the work, the voice-based explanation based on a real artist’s voice, and an art appreciation review uploaded by audiences in real-time. When it comes to the basic interface system, it is based on simple gestures such as scrolling up and down to access to the next category or swiping horizontally to access the next exhibition work.
