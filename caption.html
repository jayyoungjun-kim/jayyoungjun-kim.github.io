        The Future of Caption
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        A digital caption system based on mobile is convenient during meticulous art appreciation at large-scale exhibitions, especially unprivileged people such as the disabled, children, and the elderly. Besides, various and interesting contents related to the exhibition make the exhibition enjoyable and substantial. I called it 'The Future of Caption'. I established the system as the basic idea. It means that by using this mobile application, every gallery or museum can easily set up the most efficient and kind docent or caption in people's hands.

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        When audiences enter the exhibition, each museum has their traffic line they set up for visitors to experience the exhibition effectively. In this respect, the list of artworks on the main screen is the same as the list of artworks in the museum along the traffic line. In addition, the reduction ratio of sizes of works is the same with real sizes.

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        This app consists of five categories such as caption, the workplace of the work (map-based), pictures that were taken when an artist was doing the work, the voice-based explanation based on a real artist’s voice, and an art appreciation review uploaded by audiences in real-time. When it comes to the basic interface system, it is based on simple gestures such as scrolling up and down to access to the next category or swiping horizontally to access the next exhibition work.
