        Episode Seongsu 121 is a residential space for a one-person household run by SK D&D of SK Group. When Seongsu 121 was launched, I participated in various parts such as space design and information design as a graphic designer. One of the design works I did was to install the episode brand identity at the main entrance.

        Variation

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Rather than simply installing the logo on the general shape of the signboard, we decided to solve it with space graphic that melt into the space. Rather than arranging the logo shape as it is, I tried to give a sense of rhythm to the space by changing the angle to give fun to the space.

        Demension
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        I decided to use the entire right wall of the lobby so that people can fully feel the space of Episode 121 as they walk through the lobby. Instead of arranging it as it is, I cut the logo so that it plays a role as a space graphic rather than just a signboard.

        Texture
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The entrance lobby used exposed concrete walls. I didn't think polished or slick texture space graphic would suit exposed concrete because of the sense of the difference between space and graphic. So, I decided that a rough and matte texture would look good, so I applied the logo to the wall and sanded it to give it a rough feel.
