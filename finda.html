        FINDA is the platform that recommends suitable financial products for people who have difficulties in financial decisions. For the goal of the service, we decided that we need to build a website being able to get personalized information easier and quicker than other platforms that provide separately. At this point, the project was begun.

        Service Improvement Scope
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Commonly, the behavior when people have a need to find financial products are divided into three steps such as 'Visit', 'Search' and 'Buy'. Among these steps, we focused on the improvement of 'Search' as our MVP. The reason is that if we focus on 'Visit', it requires a variety of considerations, such as business or marketing. Furthermore, after passing to the connected other services, the part FINDA can control is rapidly reduced.

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Most users did not know where to start when entering the financial portal site. We provided three categories of promotional buttons at the top of the home that allow users to easily navigate to the information they need without going through GNB.

        Users are often lost their way in numerous financial products. To solve this problem, we focused on search, filter, and sorting functions so that when users enter each category, they can intuitively search for the information they want.

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        In the detailed information of each financial product, two items were intensively considered. It was to provide reviews and blog content related to each project . Reviews, as evidenced in the e-commerce world, are an important measure of trust in a product, and content serves as a guide to learn more about the product.

        Using the image of the satisfaction that can be obtained from each insurance, we intended the user to be attracted to the insurance. Furthermore, we have designed and provided interesting calculators that can measure each circumstance in their current asset status as a guide to get financial products that they need.
