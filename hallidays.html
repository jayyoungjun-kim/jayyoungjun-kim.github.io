      <div class="project__bodytext">
        NFT is a digital item you can truly own. NFTs have exciting new properties: they’re unique, provably scarce, liquid, and usable across multiple applications. Just like physical goods, you can do whatever you want with them! You could throw them in the trash, gift them to a friend across the world, or go sell them on an open marketplace. But unlike physical goods, they're armed with all the programmability of digital assets. NFT live on a blockchain, so no one can ever take them away from you, not even the person who created them.

        Vision
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Halliday's teams up with Top artists and brands to create collections of limited edition, high quality digital goods often referred to as a non-fungible token, or NFT, exclusively available on our platform. We've teamed up with people like Korean actor Ryu Jun-yeol, Korean popstar Kim Jaewun, and world renowned digital artist Vector Meldrew, to name a few. We hope to bring mass market awareness through the vast fan base of K-celebrities by teaming them up with digital artists for a joint collaboration project.

        Concept
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Each collection will be opened at a specific time (a drop) with ample pre-notification, and will only be available for a limited time. We aim to do new drops about once every 3 weeks. After the initial drop for a collection closes or sells out, you will only be able to get the NFTs from other open marketplaces.

        Layout

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Layouts are the culmination of defined spatial rules and the organization of content into one single composition. Bringing together your content into thoughtful structures is the easy part, making it all flow together with a clear hierarchy across a sea of changing platforms and screen sizes is the hard part.

        Home
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The home is divided into four main sections. Since the most important purpose of the platform is to generate revenue from the sale of NFT works, the most significant section is the information about upcoming drops at the top. The next is an email subscription input box that informs you about various notices. Below is the carousel component informing the most popular top collectibles at the moment. Last but not least is the section including CTA buttons, which can attract interested creators or sponsors.

        About
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The purpose of the about page is simple. It is to provide information about the service. It provide the information an overview of what NFT is, what Holidays is trying to do with NFT, and how users can participate. The most important part here is the diagram. The diagram in each section serves to explain the difficult-to-explain NFT marketplace and Halliday's service as simply and concisely as possible.

        Drops
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The drop page is the most important part of the service, as it is a section where you can explore the artist's works in earnest. The page is divided into 3 sections such as current drops, upcoming drops, and ended drops called gallery. The reason for exposing the closed drop is that it can show the direction and identity that the service pursues by showing which artists and works they are collaborating with.

        Drop Detail

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        If you select a work by an artist you like from the drop page, you will be taken to the detailed description page for that work. The page is in the form of a post. At the top, images related to the work are shown in a carousel, and in the next section, the artist profile and SNS information are provided. Finally, it consists of a detailed work description section in post format.
