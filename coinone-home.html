        Coinone Home Screen Renewal
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Coinone product team proceeded home screen renewal. We focused on the purpose and usability of the exchange to provide the best environment for users. Our key mission was to increase the entry rate of the exchange through the home screen.

        Problem Findings
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The fundamental source of income for an exchange is, of course, transaction fees. Nevertheless, the exchange conversion rate from the home screen was 26.5%, which was below expectations. In addition, the improvement of the event banner section was inevitable due to the low event banner click-through rate like 4.1%.

        KPI Setting
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Two KPIs were set based on the problem findings. The first KPI is to send as many people as possible from the home screen to the exchange, maximizing the commission profit through the potential increase in transaction demand. The second KPI is to provide a variety of content, thereby making people feel interested in trading.

        Survey Findings
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Although the conversion rate from the home screen to the exchange by using the previous marketbook was low, more than half of users monitored, of which 70% monitor mainly the cryptocurrency they were interested in.

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        When checking the overall market, several information are generally most used such as trading volume, skyrocketing, and nosedive. So, we decided to present the above information at the forefront.

        Information Architecture

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        In order to achieve the KPI, we set up a structure with five upper categories and listed the necessary subcategories accordingly. The market book and its sub-elements are for exchange conversion rates, and information, events, guides, and company introductions are intended to increase contents CTR.

        In the previous situation, users had to scroll to the marketbook below the event banners and afterwards, use filters by a select box and drop-down menu. It was tiresome everytime. By reorganizing the filters as the top menu, we have improved it easy to see the ranking cryptocurrency by filter from beginners to advanced users.

        Detailed Information

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Users normally had to enter the exchange to get the information that helped them trade because the previous marketbook offered information that was not enough. In this sense, we hypothesized that if the marketbook on the home screen provides more detailed information for trading, the probability of going directly to the interesting cryptocurrency, and trading will increase. So, we provided more detailed information such as the amount of change, the closing price and the mount curve chart for each coin.

        By separating the search box from the market book and placing it at the top on the home screen, users can more easily and quickly find the cryptocurrency they want to move to the exchange. In addition, by utilizing the history of the recent search cryptocurrency, users can move quickly to the exchange with one click.

        Crypto News

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        For an exchange to gain the trust and interest of users, it must understand cryptocurrency properly. This is because unverified cryptocurrency listings or incorrect information delivery can lead to loss of trust from users. Crypto News provides a variety of contents such as market briefings, chart analysis, and research, which means that the exchange also actively prepares for users' risks and encourages correct investment.

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The previous event area occupied the large cover area and three small banner areas at the top. The marketbook was almost invisible because the event area was full on the first screen. The CTRs were very low and especially, the top cover area was a waste of space for a long time when there were no events. To solve this problem, we have changed the event area to slide type and integrated layout system for an easy and quick approach to each event.
