          Big Brother is watching you
        </div>
        Among various forms of surveillance, the seriousness of camera surveillance was already expected in 1949 by George Orwell who an English author. In the society, every citizen is under camera surveillance by the authorities, mainly by
        telescreen. “Big Brother is watching you” is a slogan and maxim of the society to warn people of obeying the society without doubts. The novel and movie “1984” made me focus on the problem of camera surveillance.

        A project called <a href="https://superflux.in/index.php/work/drones/#" target="_blank">“Drone Aviary”</a> designed by Superflux shows that the possibility of future regarding the era of surveillance drone policing. The monitoring system will
        make the public more monitored indiscriminately and confidentially.
        <br><br>
        'Nightwatchman, The Surveillance Drone' written by Superflux:
        A highly mobile data acquisition device used by everyone from local councils to law enforcement agencies. By securely connecting to a centralised database The Nightwatchman is able to amass and utilise huge amounts of location and subject
        specific information assisting in everything from documenting civil offences to detecting potential terror threats.

      <div class="project__bodytext__point">
        What if surveillance drone system itself may protect privacy for people’s visual anonymity by blurring faces? It is possible to become a point of compromise to mitigate the tensions between privacy and surveillance against indiscriminate
        camera surveillance. Would it become an appropriate suggestion from the irrational to rational drone monitoring system for citizens?

          Face Protection as a Form of Resistance
        </div>
        There were numerous attempts to conceal faces against camera surveillance in design practice. The most featured project is ‘CV Dazzle’ related to face protection that can resist camera surveillance by camouflaging faces. It is representing ‘A
        Form of Resistance’. The designer realised that for the purpose of hiding faces from CCTVs, we need to make the facial recognition systems confused with a way putting something on faces. In fact, facial recognition systems commonly have the
        same working process as to the basic structure of faces.
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/how-facial-recognition-works-the-ghost-in-the-camera/" target="_blank">“Essentially what is being looked at is a landscape of the face. … Facial recognition software takes various measurements
          of each face and turns these into a string
          of numbers. Then it’s just a matter of comparing one string of numbers with another. The higher the similarity score, the more likely it is that you’re looking at the same person.”</a>
        <br><br>
        By the algorithm above, facial recognition is generally working. It means that if we want to hide our faces by using methods like ‘camouflage’, watched and stored images and videos by camera surveillance cannot be recognised and identified.
        It is an essential point to protect our identity from vast camera surveillance aviary.
        <br><br>
        “If you want to be invisible from the system, you should hide your face.”

          Protection system as a Form of Compromise
        </div>
        As a form of ‘Compromise’, not like a form of ‘Resistance’ like ‘CV Dazzle’, two typical corporations: YouTube and Google have had endeavours to protect faces. They launched a function to blur faces to keep ‘Visual Anonymity’.
        <br><br>
        In 2012, YouTube uploaded a post with a title ‘Face blurring: when footage requires anonymity’. Some sentences inform us of their key aim of the service.
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://youtube.googleblog.com/2012/07/face-blurring-when-footage-requires.html" target="_blank">“Whether you want to share sensitive protest footage without exposing the faces of the activists involved, or share the winning point in
          your 8-year-old’s basketball game without broadcasting the children’s faces to the world, our face
          blurring technology is a first step towards providing visual anonymity for video on YouTube.”</a>
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://youtube.googleblog.com/2012/07/face-blurring-when-footage-requires.html" target="_blank">“Visual anonymity in video allows people to share personal footage more widely and to speak out when they otherwise may not.”</a>
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://youtube.googleblog.com/2012/07/face-blurring-when-footage-requires.html" target="_blank">“Because human rights footage, in particular, opens up new risks to the people posting videos and to those filmed, it’s important to
          keep in mind other ways to protect yourself and the people in your videos.”</a>
        <br><br>
        These systems show us how privacy and personal identity are significant.
