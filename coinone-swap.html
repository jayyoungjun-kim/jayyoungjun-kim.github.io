      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Planning Cell at COINONE designed and launched a new trading system called SWAP much more concise and easier than the current exchange. We identified the shortcomings of the existing exchange and deeply thought about how to improve them. And it was to create a new service called SWAP, and it is a successful project that dramatically increased the trading volume of coins provided by SWAP.

        Problem Finding 01

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Beginners, value investors, and others who are not familiar with trading have got to know about cryptocurrency. Let's think about their shoes. When they enter the exchange page, vast information such as a chart, market book, order book, and other difficult trading terms of typical cryptocurrency exchange can be a burden for them.
      </div>

      <div class="project__img">

        Problem Finding 02
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        There are numerous cryptocurrencies that are failed to receive a proper evaluation because of newly listed coins or transactions concentrated in the main market. It is true that if the chart or order book is dead, it is difficult to trade, even if you are interested in the coin. We needed a system for cryptocurrencies that were delisted due to a lack of transaction volume.

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        As mentioned above, we found two problems with the trading system. Too much information for beginners and value investors can be solved with a concise and easy trading system. In addition, coins with no trading volume do not have to show their weaknesses.
        <br><br>
        Here we found something in common that can solve both problems. That is, unless it is essential information for the trading, it does not show other than essential information.

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Important but not essential information from the exchange was drastically deleted one by one. The information that was considered basic as an auxiliary indicator for trading such as fluctuation rate, high price, low price, previous day price, volume, chart, order book, market depth, and market book was not essential information for trading decision.

        Excluding all non-essential information, there are three essential information remaining. If users only have the information about the current price, the maximum trading volume, and the balance, they can trade easily and quickly without any other difficult thinking.

        We designed easy and intuitive wireframes based on the three selected information. The most important thing when setting up a framework is to understand the whole flow from users entering SWAP service to completing trading. The information is prioritized and designed according to the user's gaze and flow of actions.

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        For using SWAP, users select an asset they own for sell and an asset they want to buy. However, in the current service, all cryptocurrency is not swapped 1:1, so users can check and select a list of coins that can be used for swap and coins that cannot be used from the drop-down menu.

        The price is reset every 10 seconds, and the round gauge design makes it possible to predict when the price will change. The maximum swap volume is the maximum amount that can be swaped at a time, while the balance is the amount I currently have based on the selected assets.

        SWAP is made as soon as users click the buy button. It is the same as trading at the market price. We have added a confirmation function to prevent accidental clicking of the buy button. The buy button is activated only by checking the check box. After completing the swap, users can click the ‘Swap history' button and check the trading history in my balance.

        We are providing a service that is similar to deposits and installment savings called PLUS. Users can receive interest as a linked product immediately after swapping. We also provide brief information about the cryptocurrency they want to buy for helping the decision of swapping.
