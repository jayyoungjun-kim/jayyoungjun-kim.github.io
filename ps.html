        As we get older, the number of medications we take increases, and from one day we can't remember what we are taking every day and what's left inside of a drawer. Many pills are similar or identical in shape, and so many kinds are difficult to
        find.

        Throughout a pill picture, Image Recognition-based Pill Scanner immediately analyzes the size, text, shape, and color of the medicine at once and delivers the information of the medicine. In cooperation with Korea's representative drug

        Problem Solving
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        One of the problems faced by hospitals, especially general hospitals, is that it is difficult to keep track of the various new drugs that many patients bring. To address this issue, it provides an easy search function that allows for faster
        acquisition of information, allowing the hospital to focus more on patient care. Conversely, by providing the public with details and additional information about the drug, it is possible to improve medication services and increase the
        patient's right to know.

        Home
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The main focus on the home screen was easy to search. In general, when users use the search function, we assume that they will have two principal doubtful points. Firstly, It is uncertainty as to how they can get the answer they want when
        they enter the search terms, and secondly, If it is a first-time service, it is hard to predict in advance what search results will come out.
        <br><br>
        In this regard, the most effective way to solve this problem was a predictable search. If you use the functions provided such as searching shape or scanning, you will get information about your pills intuitively, and if you search for
        keywords like interaction, DUR, or Equivalence, you will get information related to each category specifically. Besides, the integrated search function helps you get overall or specific knowledge you want to know. In this way, the home screen
        has serviced various channels for search so that users can get the information they need exactly.

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        When searching by integrated search, it is listed up in order of ingredients, drugs, and classification according to the importance of corresponding information. The top three search results in each category are highly accurate, listing three
        of the closest search information, and allowing you to see more listings by viewing more.

        List of Pills Searched
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        When searching for drugs, the basic search result is a small image of a pill as shown on the left. Since more than 100 tablets can be searched according to the search results, we decided to show each pill's image as a reduced image. However,
        when there are numerous pills of similar form, it is necessary to know the correct form. For this reason, we additionally offer an enlarged image, and you can easily switch by using the floating button in the bottom right corner.

        Pill Search by Image Recognition
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The scanning function is a core feature. For pills that can be distinguished on both sides, users take a picture of one side decided as the front. It is enough to take a picture of one side to check the results. However, because the number of
        results can be copious, picturing of the back can maximize the efficiency of the search. When picturing is finished, the search number comes out. If you want to retake one of the front or back sides, click the camera icon to retake it.
        <br><br>
        When we proceeded with the service, we found that most users take pill pictures in different sizes in various environments. As a result, it also had a big impact on the accuracy of our search results. As a solution, as shown in the left
        screen, a focused area was set up to induce a large number of users to take a pill in a certain form.

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Information on pill and food interactions is provided. When taking multiple medications at the same time, the general public is unaware of how they interact with each other. The same is true for food. There may be a deadly risk between
        medicines and foods that you may not care about.
        <br><br>
        The pill and food interactions of the medicines can be easily searched and check the situation, especially with intuitive interaction-related icons.

        DUR is a drug-related contraindication called Drug Utilization Review.
