        29CM Online Advertising

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        I established 29CM's design guide for online advertising. 29CM has many different categories and numerous brands. In these countless situations, my goal was to help each brand contents designer to design more efficiently under a certain guide.

        Problem Findings
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        29CM's online advertising did not have a design guide. Depending on the designers and the situations, it was designed. It causes long production times that are difficult to schedule and consistently low conversion rates. Recognizing the problem, I decided to provide an optimal design guide for 29CM's online advertising. I took on the role of the project owner and brand content designer and carried out the project as an independent TF team.

        Image
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Image selection is one of the significant parts of the final output in online advertising. To give strength to the image, I decided to choose an image that is close to a product or person without a complicated background. The image can be freely enlarged and reduced according to the condition of the image to find the optimal layout.

        * It is recommended to use more than six spaces for product and person images

      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Numerous images have various layouts and different brightness and saturation. There is a limit to effective information delivery using the space in an image. That's why I put a transparent black object so that it always maintains high readability regardless of the state of the image.

        Spacing
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        A safety margin is essential so that the content placed on the image is not cropped or difficult to see depending on the situation. In addition, the spacing between each element is set so that various components such as title, subtext, and logo can be harmoniously composed.

        Typography
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        29CM has a variety of categories such as men, women, lifestyle, tech, etc. In addition, we provide customers with numerous brands and products in each category. Therefore, typography with various layouts and sizes is essentially required. I designed four types and provided recommended guides for typographic design such as basic type, brand type, product type, and PT type.

        Achievement
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The outcome of the project was successful. Both long production times and low conversion rates have been successfully converted to meaningful figures. First, production time, which previously took more than 16 hours, has been significantly reduced to 4 hours. Due to the fact that it effectively gave the manpower to other projects. Second, we achieved a 1.7 times higher conversion rate than before. It can be said that the successful conversion rate was achieved with elements such as images and typography optimized for online advertising.
