        COINONE Home Renewal
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Web product team proceeded home screen renewal. We focused on the purpose and usability of the exchange to provide the best environment for users. Our key mission was to increase the entry rate of the exchange through the home screen.

        Data Analysis
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The conversion rate from the previous home screen to the exchange was 16.15% of the total number of events. We felt the shortage of the numerical value and decided to consider about how to increase the conversion rate to the exchange.

        Hypothesis
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The only way to enter the exchange from the previous home screen was the table-type market book. There was no others to check information about cryptocurrencies. Our team hypothesized. If we provided various trading information on the home screen, we thought that users who obtained various trading information would move to the exchange for trading.

        Filters
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        When checking the overall market, several information are most important such as trading volume, skyrocketing, and plummeting. In the previous market book, users had to find these filters by a drop-down menu. By reorganizing the filters as top menu, we have made it easy to see the ranking coins by filter from beginners to advanced users.

        Market Book
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        In the previous market book, users could only see brief information such as the current price, fluctuation rate, and trading value. So, they had to enter the exchange to get the information that actually helped them trade. In this sense, we provided more detailed information  including the amount of change, the closing price and the mount curve chart for each coin. This helped users to make some decisions about trading before entering the exchange.

        Search Coins
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Our team found that many people used the search box in the market book. By separating the search box from the market book and placing it at the top on the home screen, users can more easily and quickly find the coin they want to move to the exchange. In addition, by utilizing the history of the recent search coins, users can move quickly to the exchange with one click.

        Market Book on Mobile
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        We have taken the same direction on the mobile web. However, some detailed information like the mount curve chart was excluded to expose because it was considered inappropriate in space on the mobile view.

        Real-time News
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Real-time news is a very important key indicator of the value of cryptocurrency. Words from influential people or various news affect the price of the coin. In this sense, we decided to provide real-time coin news around the world to help users trade.

        Notice Board
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        Quickly delivering various news such as scheduled system maintenance or new coin listing is extremely significant for trading. The traditional bulletin board format is the most familiar and easy to read on the Internet era, so the notice and project information is exposed on the home screen in the form of bulletin boards.

        New Events
      </div>
      <div class="project__bodytext">
        The previous event area occupied the large cover area and three small banner areas at the top. However, the clickthrough rate (CTR) was very low and the top cover area was a waste of space for a long time when there were no events. To solve this problem, we changed the event area to slide type and integrated layout system for operation.

        We have displayed snapshot of airdrop service as a timer UI, and we expect that it will be more visible to people. Snapshot area is also designed to be slides because there are always two or more.

        The desktop view is a combination of each component mentioned above. The top is for trading such as filter, market book, and search box. The bottom left area allows you to see various posts, while the right area allows you to see coin events and more.

        After the home screen renewal, the conversion rate of entering the exchange increased by 5.89%. The hypothesis we established is proved through the efficient improvement of trading information system.
